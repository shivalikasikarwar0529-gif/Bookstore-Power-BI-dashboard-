# Bookstore Strategic Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a bookstore's performance, inventory, and customer base. As a Data Analyst, I developed this end-to-end solution to help stakeholders track sales trends, manage stock levels, and identify top-performing genres and authors.

The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights, focusing on revenue growth and inventory efficiency.
